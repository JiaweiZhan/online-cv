    title: Incoming Ph.D. candidate @ UChicago
    summary: |
      I’m fascinated by the efficiency of using computational technics 
      to numerically simulate or predict materials’ properties. 
      Also, I really enjoy implementing or developing new algorithms 
      to break through restrictions that are ubiquitous in the computational physics’ field. 
      My passion for this subject has led me to pursue further studies and ultimately, 
      a career in computational physics.

experiences:
    - role: Research Assistant
      time: Jul. 2019 – Sep. 2019
      company: Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Pittburgh, PA, USA
      details: |
        Designed and implemented a state-of-the-art python package for predicting 
        the most likely structure of organic interfaces.
          - Designed a graph-theory algorithm for efficient slab generation, which outperformed all 
          previous algorithms in conserving the atom numbers and structures as well as mechanical properties
          - Implemented a lattice matching algorithm for optimizing the lattice parameters of new 
          interfaces and the coordinates of every atom
          - Created a Graphic Neural Network (GNN) model for predicting organic systems‘ non-bonded interactions, 
          with the efficiency of empirical methods and the accuracy of DFT method
          - Used three different workflows to optimize the structure of interfaces, and GNN exceeded others in 
          accuracy and time cost (Errors < 3%, 10000 × faster than DFT)
    - role: Research Assistant
      time: Mar. 2019 – Jul. 2019
      company: University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, Anhui, China
      details: |
        Improved the efficiency of CO2 photoreduction by doping alkali metal 
        element to engineer the electronic properties of the catalyst
          - Found the most stable relaxed configuration of the potassium-doped g-C3N4 and 
          predicted the most practicable doping density as a reference for the experiment
          - Theoretically proved that potassium doping changes monolayer g-C3N4 from indirect gap to direct gap
          - Calculated numerically the formation energy and Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of hydrogen atom adsorption on 
          g-C3N4 and K-doped g-C3N4 , proved that the CO2 reduction with K-doped g-C3N4 is more efficient than that with ordinary pristine g-C3N4
          - Used differential charge density to numerically prove that K-doping alters the charge distribution of g-C3N4 and inhibit the 
          electron-hole pair recombination
    - role: Research Assistant
      time: Sep. 2018 – Jan. 2019
      company: University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, Anhui, China
      details: |
        Numerically proved that oxygen doping could enhance SnS2’s 
        photocatalytic property in visible-light-driven CO2 reduction
          - Analyzed the electronic structure and magnetic properties of O-doped SnS2 and Ni-O-doped SnS2 
          via DFT, proved that oxidation had impact on charges’ distribution
          - Proved numerically that oxygen-doping made Sn the binding sites of the reaction and could decrease formation energy of a 
          significant step that influenced the whole CO2 reduction process
          - Calculated the optimized structure of different doped SnS2 to quickly predict whether the novel materials could be produced in experiment
