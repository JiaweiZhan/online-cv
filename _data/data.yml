career-profile:
    title: Incoming Ph.D. candidate @ UChicago
    summary: |
      I’m fascinated by the efficiency of using computational technics 
      to numerically simulate or predict materials’ properties. 
      Also, I really enjoy implementing or developing new algorithms 
      to break through restrictions that are ubiquitous in the computational physics’ field. 
      My passion for this subject has led me to pursue further studies and ultimately, 
      a career in computational physics.

experiences:
    - role: Research Assistant
      time: Jul. 2019 – Sep. 2019
      company: Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Pittburgh, PA, USA
      details: |
        Designed and implemented a state-of-the-art python package for predicting 
        the most likely structure of organic interfaces.
          - Designed a graph-theory algorithm for efficient slab generation, which outperformed all 
          previous algorithms in conserving the atom numbers and structures as well as mechanical properties
          - Implemented a lattice matching algorithm for optimizing the lattice parameters of new 
          interfaces and the coordinates of every atom
          - Created a Graphic Neural Network (GNN) model for predicting organic systems‘ non-bonded interactions, 
          with the efficiency of empirical methods and the accuracy of DFT method
          - Used three different workflows to optimize the structure of interfaces, and GNN exceeded others in 
          accuracy and time cost (Errors < 3%, 10000 × faster than DFT)
    - role: Senior Software Engineer
      time: 2014 - 2015
